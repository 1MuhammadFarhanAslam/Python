    "### Project: Random Number Guessing Game\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** Create a game where the computer picks a random number, and the user tries to guess it. The game will provide hints (higher/lower) until the correct number is guessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can approach building your guessing game, focusing on using classes and objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Design the `GuessingGame` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll want a class to encapsulate the game's logic. Think about what data your game needs and what actions it performs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class Name:** `GuessingGame`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attributes (Data it holds):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `secret_number`: The random number the computer picks. This should be generated when a `GuessingGame` object is created.\n",
    "2.  `max_number`: The upper limit for the random number (e.g., if it's 10, the number will be between 1 and 10).\n",
    "3.  `min_number`: The lower limit for the random number (e.g., 1).\n",
    "4.  `guesses_taken`: How many tries the player has made.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods (Actions it performs):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `__init__(self, min_num, max_num)`:\n",
    "    * This is your constructor. It should initialize `min_number`, `max_number`, and `guesses_taken`.\n",
    "    * Crucially, it should **generate the `secret_number`** using Python's `random` module (you'll need to `import random` at the top of your file).\n",
    "2.  `check_guess(self, guess)`:\n",
    "    * Takes the user's `guess` as input.\n",
    "    * **Increments `guesses_taken`**.\n",
    "    * Compares the `guess` to the `secret_number`.\n",
    "    * Returns a string indicating:\n",
    "        * \"Too low!\" if the guess is less than the `secret_number`.\n",
    "        * \"Too high!\" if the guess is greater than the `secret_number`.\n",
    "        * \"Correct!\" if the guess is equal to the `secret_number`.\n",
    "3.  `get_guesses_taken(self)`:\n",
    "    * Returns the current value of `guesses_taken`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Implement the Game Loop (Outside the Class)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your `GuessingGame` class, you'll need to write the code that actually runs the game. This will involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Creating an instance of your `GuessingGame` class:** For example, `game = GuessingGame(1, 100)`.\n",
    "2.  **A `while` loop:** This loop will continue until the user guesses correctly.\n",
    "3.  **Getting user input:** Prompt the user to enter their guess. Remember to convert their input to an integer using `int()`.\n",
    "4.  **Calling the `check_guess` method:** Pass the user's guess to this method.\n",
    "5.  **Printing the result:** Display the feedback (\"Too low!\", \"Too high!\", \"Correct!\").\n",
    "6.  **Breaking the loop:** If the guess is \"Correct!\", exit the `while` loop.\n",
    "7.  **Displaying the final score:** Once the game ends, tell the user how many guesses it took them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Add Error Handling (Optional but Recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "* What if the user enters text instead of a number? Use a `try-except` block to catch `ValueError` when converting input to an integer.\n",
    "* What if the user enters a number outside your `min_number` and `max_number` range? You can add checks for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Flow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "--- Random Number Guessing Game ---\n",
    "I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\n",
    "Enter your guess: 50\n",
    "Too low!\n",
    "Enter your guess: 75\n",
    "Too high!\n",
    "Enter your guess: 62\n",
    "Too low!\n",
    "Enter your guess: 68\n",
    "Correct! You guessed the number in 4 guesses!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Take your time with each step. If you get stuck, try breaking down the problem even further or refer back to your class and object notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck! Let me know if you want to tackle another OOP concept after this."
