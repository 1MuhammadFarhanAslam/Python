    "### What is Overfitting and Underfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Overfitting**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:**  \n",
    "  When a model **learns too much**, including **noise and random fluctuations** in the training data, instead of just learning the useful or valuable patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Result:**  \n",
    "  - Very high accuracy on training data (model becomes a \"ratta master\").  \n",
    "  - Poor performance on new, unseen data (test data).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:**  \n",
    "  A model memorizes every customer behavior perfectly in training but completely fails when a slightly different customer comes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reason:**  \n",
    "  - Model is **too complex** (like too many decision tree splits, too many layers in a neural network).  \n",
    "  - Not enough training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution:**  \n",
    "  - Use **simpler models**.  \n",
    "  - Use **regularization** (L1, L2 penalties).  \n",
    "  - Increase **training data**.  \n",
    "  - Use **cross-validation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Underfitting**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:**  \n",
    "  When a model **is too simple** to capture the valuable or useful patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Result:**  \n",
    "  - Poor performance both on training and testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:**  \n",
    "  A model that always predicts \"house price = ₹50 lakh\" no matter what features you give — because it didn't learn anything useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reason:**  \n",
    "  - Model is **too basic** (like fitting a straight line to a complex curve).  \n",
    "  - Not enough training time.  \n",
    "  - Wrong features selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solution:**  \n",
    "  - Use **more complex models**.  \n",
    "  - Train for a **longer time**.  \n",
    "  - **Feature engineering** (add better features).\n",
