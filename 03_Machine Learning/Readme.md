# Machine Learning -(In simplest form))

Imagine you are a little kid. Your mother shows you different fruits every day:

- She points to a mango and says, "Beta (son), this is a mango."
- She points to a watermelon and says, "This is a watermelon."
- Next day, you see a new fruit yourself — and based on what you've seen before, you think:  
  *"It’s yellow and small... maybe it's a mango!"*

**That’s exactly what Machine Learning is!**  
Just like humans learn from examples without being given exact rules, machines also learn patterns from examples so that they can make decisions on new situations — **without us programming every single rule**.

# In a Slightly More Formal Way

> **Machine Learning** is the method of making a machine smart enough to learn from data, so that it can make decisions or predictions on new data without being explicitly programmed for each scenario.

**"Machine Learning is the art of training a machine through data, so that it becomes smart enough to handle new situations and make decisions — just like how a mother says: 'Learn, my child, understand the colors of the world'."**
